# Zest For Ride 

![](/docs/Am%20I%20Responsive.png)

Zest For Ride - the social media web app for motorcycle enthusiasts. Connect, share, and explore with passionate bikers worldwide. Personalize your profile, join comments on bikes, events, and mods, and track and share your epic rides.

Zest For Ride provides an interactive platform to create, view, edit, and delete posts and events. The user who wishes to share an event or post can upload information about them, the user can like and comment on posts, the user can be interested in events, and the user can follow other users.

The overall structure of the project was based on Code Institutes [Moments](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/moments) walkthrough, with additional custom components added by me.
