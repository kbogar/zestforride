# Zest For Ride 

![](/docs/Am%20I%20Responsive.png)

Zest For Ride - the social media web app for motorcycle enthusiasts. Connect, share, and explore with passionate bikers worldwide. Personalize your profile, join comments on bikes, events, and mods, and track and share your epic rides.

Zest For Ride provides an interactive platform to create, view, edit, and delete posts and events. The user who wishes to share an event or post can upload information about them, the user can like and comment on posts, the user can be interested in events, and the user can follow other users.

The overall structure of the project was based on Code Institutes [Moments](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/moments) walkthrough, with additional custom components added by me.

# Entity Relationship Diagram
Before starting the project, I conducted thorough research to define the data models needed for the application. This involved identifying entities, relationships, and creating a comprehensive list of fields and actions required for the app to function correctly. With this information, I built the necessary models, ensuring the application meets its goals.

# Agile Methodology
- This project was developed using the agile methodology and version control on GitHub. Tasks were tracked and managed through Github's issue-tracking system, allowing for rapid progress and continued progress tracking.
- The User Stories were organized by must haves, should haves, as well as required backend API functionality labels.

Agile Methodology proved invaluable for my project. Breaking it into smaller tasks helped me track progress, stay on schedule, and adapt plans efficiently. The satisfaction of completing User Stories was a great motivator.

# User Experience (UX)

## Wireframes
Wireframes were initially created on paper to help decide the most important aspects of the web app.
Afterward, the wireframes for this site were created in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) software.

The wireframes for this project could differ from the final design due to modifications made during the development process.
